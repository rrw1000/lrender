# About

This is a short bit of three.js code I wrote to render a Hilbert curve from an L-system for the 2024 admissions round.

It's about 4h of work in total, so excuse the poor structure. It does, however (clumsily!) allow you to define your own L-systems to render - 2d only for now.

# Starting

```

# Compiling

```

will build a `dist/` directory with a static version of the site.
